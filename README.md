# First Node & Git project

We created a basic app with three routes:

    / explains how /hello works
    /hello takes a name query parameter and
        random names replies hello [name]
        your own name replies with a short intro of yourself
        any other replies a 404 code with a not found message

In this app, we have the following elements :
- index.js file with the server creation and handles.js defining the server's callback
- package.json file with module declaration
